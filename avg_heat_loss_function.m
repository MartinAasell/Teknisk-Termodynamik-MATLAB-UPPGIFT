% Written by: Martin Ã…sell
% ABOUT:
%    Calculating the average heat loss per month or year.
%
% INPUTS:
%   T_data --- Temperature data (given, NOTE: type==struct)
%   T_inside - Temperature of the house (assume constant 21 degrees C)
%   no ------- Which month/year
%   varargin - 'month' or 'year'
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   Q_out ---- heat loss per month or year
%
% NOTE:
%   when calling the function, varargin needs to be a string of 'month' or
%   'year'
